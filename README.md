# Bookmarklets

Bookmarklets are bookmarks that have javascript code in them. In layman terms, they have scripts in them.

## How to use

This is an example of a bookmarklet. Copy and paste this into a bookmark.

```javascript
javascript:var url1= prompt("Please enter a website address", "https://", "hello"); window.open(url1);
```

This one isn't that useful. It just gives a prompt for a url and opens that url. The url has to have "https://" at the beginning.
```javascript
javascript:var url1= prompt("Please enter a website address", "https://", "hello"); window.open(url1);
```
